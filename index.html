            "Find that thing you are so passionate about. 
            A lot of founding principles of Facebook are 
            that if people have access to more information 
            and are more connected, it will make the world 
            better; people will have more understanding, 
            more empathy. That's the guiding principle for 
            me. On hard days, I really just step back, 
            and that's the thing that keeps me going."
